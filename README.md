# Angular Dummy Projects

This repository contains various small Angular projects created to practice and reinforce Angular fundamentals.

## Project Structure

Each project is stored in its own folder inside the `angular` directory:

```
angular/
â”‚â”€â”€ 01-starting-project/
â”‚â”€â”€ 02-routing-demo/
â”‚â”€â”€ 03-forms-practice/
â”‚â”€â”€ ...
```

## Getting Started

To run any project, navigate into its folder and install dependencies:

```sh
cd angular/01-starting-project
npm install
ng serve
```

Make sure you have the Angular CLI installed globally:

```sh
npm install -g @angular/cli
```

## Purpose

These projects serve as a learning ground for experimenting with Angular concepts such as:

- Components & Modules
- Data Binding & Directives
- Routing & Lazy Loading
- Forms & Validation
- State Management
- API Integration
